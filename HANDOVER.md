# Recro Group handover

This is the map of the live site at [recrogroup.org](https://recrogroup.org). Read this first. The code comments on the files listed at the end mark the same flows inside the repository.

`DEPLOYMENT.md` is an older DigitalOcean draft. Production runs on Vercel. Do not follow that file for the live site.

## What the site does

Recro Group is a therapy and grief-camp practice in Kenya. The site has three areas:

- The public site: services, booking, grief camp, contact, and program forms.
- The staff portal at `/dashboard`: bookings, payments, messages, and programs.
- A second staff area at `/admin` with the same data and a few Director-only pages.

Money is in Kenyan shillings. Card checkout through Paystack is wired but not the live method. Customers pay by M-Pesa Buy Goods till **747736**.

## How a change reaches the live site

1. Code lives in the GitHub repository `camalmitchy/RecroGroup`.
2. Vercel project `recro-group` (team `camal`) builds `main` and serves `recrogroup.org`.
3. The production database is Vercel Postgres. The local `.env` database is a different database. A role or booking changed locally does not appear on the live site.
4. The build command is `prisma generate && next build`. It does **not** run `prisma migrate deploy`. New columns that production needs are added at runtime by `src/lib/payments/ensure-schema.ts` when a payment or booking path runs. Keep that in mind before relying on a migration alone.

## Safe transfer order

Daraja and GoDaddy are already on the client account. Leave both alone. Do not change DNS records, Daraja keys, the till, or callback URLs.

Do this while the current site is still live. The goal is to add the client first and remove yourself last. Do not create a second Vercel project, a second database, or a new set of API keys.

**Leave these values as they are on handover day.** Changing them takes the site down or signs people out:

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (a new value signs every user out)
- `DATABASE_URL` and the Vercel Postgres store
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` and the Blob store `recro-group-blob`
- Every `MPESA_` variable, including the passkey and consumer key
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, unless the client has already created a replacement key in the same Resend team
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- GoDaddy DNS for `recrogroup.org`

**Day of the transfer**

1. Open the live site, the Vercel project, and a recent successful deployment. Do not redeploy yet.
2. Invite the client into each account below as an owner or admin. Do not transfer or delete anything in this step.
3. Sit with them and confirm they can open the repo, the Vercel project (including Postgres, Blob, the domain, and the environment variables), Resend, and the Google Cloud project. They should sign in on the site as `info@recrogroup.org` and see the Director role.
4. Only after that, transfer ownership one account at a time. After each transfer, reload `https://recrogroup.org` and confirm the latest Vercel deployment is still Ready.
5. Stay on the accounts for a few days. Remove yourself only after the client has logged in alone and a normal page, a staff page, and a form email still work.

**Order**

1. **Mailbox.** The domain is already theirs. Confirm they can open `info@recrogroup.org` itself (GoDaddy email, or Google Workspace if that is where the mailbox lives). That address is the Director login and the inbox for form alerts. Do not create a second mailbox.
2. **Vercel, project `recro-group`.** This account is Hobby, so it cannot invite a member. If the account contains only this project, add the client's email under Account Settings, make it the primary email, and let them set the password. The project, database, Blob store, domain, and secrets stay where they are. If the account also has personal projects, do not share the login. The client creates their own Vercel account, upgrades it to Pro for the transfer, invites you, and you move the project, Blob store, and database across. Do not use Transfer while the database and Blob store are still only on your account.
3. **GitHub `camalmitchy/RecroGroup`.** Invite the client as an admin first. Transfer the repo to their account only when you are both online. Immediately afterwards, open Vercel → Settings → Git and reconnect the repo if Vercel lost it. Wait until a deployment finishes and the site still loads. Do not push code during this step.
4. **Resend.** Invite the client to the existing team that owns the verified domain `recrogroup.org`. Do not delete the API key and do not verify the domain a second time. A new Resend account would stop booking and form email until a new key is saved in Vercel and the domain is verified again.
5. **Google sign-in.** Add the client as an owner of the existing Google Cloud project. Leave the current OAuth client in place. The redirect URI stays `https://recrogroup.org/api/auth/callback/google`. A new OAuth client breaks Google sign-in until Vercel is updated and redeployed.
6. **Google Sheet.** Share the spreadsheet and the Apps Script project with the client. The current webhook keeps working while your Google login still owns the script. After they are in, they can redeploy the web app as themselves and you can update `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` in Vercel. Do that only after a test form lands in the sheet. The database still keeps every form if the sheet copy fails.
7. **Daraja and GoDaddy.** Already on the client. Do not regenerate the consumer key, consumer secret, or passkey. Callbacks must keep pointing at `https://recrogroup.org/api/payments/webhooks/mpesa`.

**Do not**

- Email or WhatsApp the `.env` file, API keys, or the database URL. The client reads those inside Vercel after they are an Owner.
- Run `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate` against the production database.
- Delete the Vercel project, Postgres store, or Blob store.
- Rotate secrets on the same day as the transfer.

Your laptop `.env` is a different database. Deleting it does not affect the live site. Keep it until you are finished helping them.

## Accounts to hand over

Transfer ownership. Do not email `.env`, API keys, or the database URL.

| What | Where it lives | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source code | GitHub `camalmitchy/RecroGroup` | Invite the new owner, then transfer the repo. |
| Hosting and database | Vercel team `camal`, project `recro-group` | Includes Vercel Postgres. |
| File storage | Vercel Blob store `recro-group-blob` | Grief-camp flyer. Served by `GET /api/grief-camp-flyer`. |
| Domain | GoDaddy, `recrogroup.org` | DNS points at Vercel. |
| Public mailbox | `info@recrogroup.org` | Also the main Director login. |
| Transactional email | Resend, domain `recrogroup.org` verified | From address `Recro Group <no-reply@recrogroup.org>`. |
| Google sign-in | Google Cloud OAuth client | Redirect URI `https://recrogroup.org/api/auth/callback/google`. |
| M-Pesa | Safaricom Daraja app | Till `747736`. Callbacks hit `/api/payments/webhooks/mpesa`. |
| Form spreadsheet | Google Sheet, filled by `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Tabs: Grief camp, Corporate speaking, Team building, Consortium. Therapist applications stay in the database only. |

After transfer, rotate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` only if the previous holder should be signed out of every session. Rotating it logs everyone out. Generate a new value with `openssl rand -base64 32` and set it in Vercel, then redeploy.

Variable names are listed in `.env.example`. Copy values from the current owner's Vercel project settings. Never commit `.env`.

## People and roles

The database stores `admin`, `receptionist`, or `customer`. The screens show different words:

| Stored role | Label on screen | What they can open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | Director | Everything, including customers, settings, and deleting a booking. |
| `receptionist` | Admin | Bookings, payments, programs, messages. Not the customer list or settings. |
| `customer` | Customer | Their own account. Staff pages redirect them home. |

If `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` is empty, signing in as `info@recrogroup.org` becomes Director. If `BOOTSTRAP_RECEPTIONIST_EMAILS` is empty, `carolinehawi91@gmail.com` becomes Admin (receptionist). This runs on every session from `src/lib/staff-bootstrap.ts`, because the production database does not copy local role edits by itself.

`minanicalm@gmail.com` was the previous Director. The next time that account signs in, it is set back to customer once. A later manual grant is left in place.

Removing a staff role in Settings sets that user to customer and remembers the email in the `revoked_staff_emails` site setting so the next sign-in does not grant the role back.

## Request flow

```
Browser page  →  server action or /api route  →  Prisma  →  Postgres
                      ↓
                 Resend email, Google Sheet, or Daraja
```

- Pages under `src/app` choose the URL and load data.
- Screens live in `src/features`.
- Mutations that the browser calls directly are in `src/server/actions` (`"use server"`).
- HTTP endpoints (M-Pesa, auth, payment status) are in `src/app/api`.
- `src/server/authz.ts` is the gate: `requireSession`, `requireStaff` (Director or Admin), `requireAdmin` (Director only).

## Public pages

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home |
| `/booking` | Book a therapy session and pay the commitment fee |
| `/grief-camp` and `/grief-camp/apply` | Camp information and the camper application |
| `/grief-camp/therapist-application` | Therapist application |
| `/grief-camp/team-building` | Team-building application |
| `/services/consortium/apply` | Consortium application |
| `/services/corporate/inquiry` | Corporate speaking inquiry |
| `/contact-us` | Contact form |
| `/sponsor-child` | Donation |
| `/payments/[reference]` | Payment result. Amount and receipt stay hidden unless the link has the payment token or the viewer is staff. |

## Staff pages

`/dashboard` is the portal staff use day to day. `/admin` is the same work with a different shell. Both require a staff session.

Program forms are split out of the general inbox by the subject line (`src/server/queries/inquiries.ts`):

| List | How a row is recognised |
| --- | --- |
| `/dashboard/inquiries` and `/admin/messages` | Contact and leftover inquiries. Program subjects are excluded. |
| Therapist applications | Subject contains "therapist application" or "facilitator application". |
| Team building | Subject contains "team builder" or "team-building". |
| Consortium | Subject contains "consortium". |
| Corporate speaking | Corporate inquiries that are not team-building or therapist applications. |

Grief-camp camper applications are **not** inquiries. They are rows in `grief_applications`.

Messages can be deleted by staff. Notifications in the bell are not stored rows: they are recent paid-booking and newsletter events from the last 7 days (`src/server/queries/notifications.ts`).

## Booking and the permanent slot

A paid booking holds a weekday and start time in Africa/Nairobi. That hold is exclusive among bookings that are paid by M-Pesa and are not `CANCELLED` or `COMPLETED`.

- **Free time** sets the booking to `COMPLETED`. The slot opens for someone else. The booking stays in the list.
- **Delete booking** is Director-only. It removes the booking and its payments, then reconciles slots.
- Clear-old tools delete bookings older than a week, older than a month, or all bookings. Grief-camp and donation payments stay unless they were attached to a deleted booking.

The rule lives in `src/server/booking-slots.ts`. The buttons call `src/server/actions/operations.ts`.

## Payments

1. The page calls `POST /api/payments/initiate` with the M-Pesa number the person typed.
2. `startCheckout` in `src/lib/payments/checkout.ts` reads the price from the database. The browser cannot set the amount.
3. A pending `payments` row is created. Its `providerMeta.accessToken` is the secret for the status page.
4. Daraja sends an STK push. The phone approves it.
5. Safaricom calls `/api/payments/webhooks/mpesa`. Settlement marks the payment `PAID`, updates the booking balance, and sends the receipt email.
6. The browser polls `GET /api/payments/status/[reference]?token=...`. Without the token, the response is only `reference` and `status`.

The stored phone on a booking, camp application, or donation is used for a new STK push only when the signed-in user owns that record or is staff. Public forms send the number the person typed.

Booking confirmation email is sent after the payment is `PAID`, not when the form is submitted.

Bank-transfer recording (`recordBankTransfer`) is staff-only and has no button in the UI.

## Forms and email

Public program forms call `submitInquiry` (`src/server/actions/inquiry.ts`). That saves an `inquiries` row, emails staff, and appends a Google Sheet row when a tab matches.

The grief-camp camper form calls `submitGriefApplication`. That saves `grief_applications`, emails staff, and appends the Grief camp sheet. The parent confirmation function exists and is not called from submit.

Form emails always include `info@recrogroup.org`, plus anyone in `MAIL_STAFF_ADDRESS`. If that variable is empty, staff mail goes to `info@recrogroup.org`. A mail failure is logged and does not fail the form.

Email and password sign-up does not prove the person owns the inbox. It checks the format, a password of at least 8 characters with a letter and a number, and that the email is new, then signs them in. Google sign-in relies on Google having already confirmed the address. Password reset does email a link.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

`npm run db:seed` loads services and grief-camp price tiers. Without those rows, checkout has no price.

`npm test` runs Vitest. CI also runs `tsc`, ESLint, and the production build.

In development, if `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is missing, the portal can pretend to be an admin. Production on Vercel has the secret set, so that bypass is not available there.
